   * <p>Returns {@link AuthzStatus#PERMIT} for {@link DocId}s the user is
   * allowed to access. Retutrns {@link AuthzStatus#DENY} for {@code DocId}s the
   * user is not allowed to access. If the document exists, {@link
   * AuthzStatus#INDETERMINATE} will not be returned for that {@code DocId}.
   *
   * <p>If the document doesn't exist, then there are several possibilities. If
   * the repository is fully-public then it will return {@code PERMIT}. This
   * will allow the caller to provide a cached version of the file to the user
   * or call {@link Adaptor#getDocContent} which should call {@link
   * Response#respondNotFound}. If the adaptor is not sensitive to users knowing
   * that certain documents do not exist, then it will return {@code
   * INDETERMINATE}. This will be interpreted as the document does not exist; no
   * cached copy will be provided to the user but the user may be informed the
   * document doesn't exist. Highly sensitive repositories may return {@code
   * DENY}.
   *
   * <p>If you experience a fatal error, feel free to throw an {@link
